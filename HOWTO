your project structure should look like this
##anything in bracket is a FOLDER anything without bracket is just a FILE
## the ">>>" just shows what should be inside the folder



----------STRUCTURE OF PROJECT FOLDER---------------------

(Project) >>> (client) ,(server),(target),devcontainer.json,gitignore,Ballerina.toml,Dependencies.toml
(client)  >>> client.bal
(server)  >>> server.bal
(target)  >>> (bin),(cache),(resources),build

---------HOW TO RUN CLIENT AND SERVER--------------------

TERMINAL-1 { - use cd and go till server 
             - then type bal run server.bal }

          ## create a user on the database and a password and change the DB_USER and DB_Password according 
          to the user you creating in mysql otherwise ERRORS!!!

TERMINAL-2 { -use cs and go till client
             - then type bal run client.bal }

            ## do not enter rubbish on the deliverylocation,instead enter Ongwediva,or Oshakati or anything like that 
                because its now fetching actual data from the database


-----------------WHAT TO EXPECT-----------------------

TERMINAL-1 { should print "---------SERVER IS RUNNING----------"}
TERINAL-2 { should prompt for the normal prompts and recommend a delivery service FOR NOW}

--------------------KEY NOTES------------------------

if you run the client and choose delivery service as international

the server must recommend/ print saying recommended is standard,,,this means its working correctly cause in the database ther is no 
areaname that is over 100 from HQ yet,we will have to populate that data..

so the server now is basically taking the deliverylocation from client, fetching the town that matches that name,and getting the 
distance saved in the database

------------------------SOME AREAS TO WORK ON-------------------
 > [database side] adding new data in the serviceable table for towns out of namibia and setting their distance to 100+ to show that its international
 > [server side] adding a new function that saves the user's request in the database (considering the tables and using all of them)
 > [server side] adding a new function to fetch the order data using an order_id (we might need to use orderID as foreign key in the other tables)
 > [client side] adding a new function to request for order data (should be a get request not a post request)

thats all i can think of RN
