your project structure should look like this
##anything in bracket is a FOLDER anything without bracket is just a FILE
## the ">>>" just shows what should be inside the folder



----------STRUCTURE OF PROJECT FOLDER---------------------

(Project) >>> (client) ,(server),(target),devcontainer.json,gitignore,Ballerina.toml,Dependencies.toml
(client)  >>> client.bal
(server)  >>> server.bal
(target)  >>> (bin),(cache),(resources),build

---------HOW TO RUN CLIENT AND SERVER--------------------

TERMINAL-1 { - use cd and go till your server folder
             - then type bal run server.bal }

          ## in your database, create a user and a password and change the DB_USER and DB_Password variables at the server code according 
          to the user that you created otherwise ERRORS!!!

TERMINAL-2 { -use cs and go till your client folder
             - then type bal run client.bal }

            ## do not enter rubbish on the deliverylocation,instead enter Ongwediva,or Oshakati or any other town thats in the database
            because its now fetching actual data from the database (just the town distance for now)


-----------------WHAT TO EXPECT-----------------------

TERMINAL-1 { should print "---------SERVER IS RUNNING----------"} meaning server is runnning dumbass
TERINAL-2 { should prompt for the normal prompts and recommend a delivery service (FOR NOW) }

--------------------KEY NOTES------------------------

if you run the client and choose delivery service as international

the server must recommend/ print saying recommended is standard,,,this means its working correctly cause in the database ther is no 
town that is over 100 from HQ yet, we will have to populate that data..

so the server now is basically taking the deliverylocation from client, fetching the town that matches that name,and getting the 
distance saved in the database if distance is over 100 its automatically international
(which wont happen cause we still only have distances of less then 100 in our database)

------------------------SOME AREAS TO WORK ON-------------------
 > [database side] adding new data in the serviceable table for towns out of namibia and setting their distance to 100+ to show that its international
 > [server side] adding a new function that saves the user's request in the database (considering the tables and using all of their attributes)
 > [server side] adding a new function to fetch the order data using an order_id (we might need to use orderID as foreign key in the other tables)
 > [client side] adding a new function to request for order data (should be a get request not a post request)

thats all i can think of RN

NEW AREAS TO WORK ON---------------14\10\2024--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR KAFKA FILE(file with kafka code innit)
>for tracking we have to get a code that gets tracking id and customer information and displays it in a message
>CREATE A TRACKING topic with appropriate information.
>Consumer implementation(come up with consumer code)

.FOR SERVER.bal connect database and server to store information in database. server can already retrieve information
>when you click on tracking it can turn on kafka cluster
